# Craftz Boss Maker
## The boss maker for the Craftz Unleashed Modded Server

This is intended for the Craftz Unleashed Dev Team to easily create bosses. It is not recommended for public use, though you can try it I guess. I am planning on making another version that is far more powerful. I won't be making any documentation for this beyond the ability config specifications, though you can count on some in-depth documentation for the next version. It is intended to output a Java class that can run in Paper plugins.
